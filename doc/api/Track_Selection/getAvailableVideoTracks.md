# getAvailableVideoTracks

## Description

### Returned object

Returns the list of available video tracks for the current content.

Each of the objects in the returned array have the following properties:

- `id` (`string`): The id used to identify the track. Use it for setting the track via
  `setVideoTrack`.

- `active` (`Boolean`): Whether this track is the one currently active or not.

- `label` (`string|undefined`): A human readable label that may be displayed in the user
  interface providing a choice between video tracks.

  This information is usually set only if the current Manifest contains one.

- `representations` (`Array.<Object>`):
  [Representations](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#representation) of this video track,
  with attributes:

  - `id` (`string`): The id used to identify this Representation.

  - `bitrate` (`Number|undefined`): The bitrate of this Representation, in bits per
    seconds.

    `undefined` if unknown.

  - `width` (`Number|undefined`): The width of video, in pixels.

  - `height` (`Number|undefined`): The height of video, in pixels.

  - `codec` (`string|undefined`): The video codec the Representation is in, as announced
    in the corresponding Manifest.

  - `frameRate` (`number|undefined`): The video framerate.

  - `hdrInfo` (`Object|undefined`) Information about the hdr characteristics of the track.
    (see [HDR support documentation](.././Miscellaneous/hdr.md#hdrinfo))

  - `isCodecSupported` (`Boolean|undefined`): If `true` the codec(s) of that
    Representation is supported by the current platform.

    Note that unless you set the `filterPlayableRepresentations` option to `false`, no
    Representation with a `isCodecSupported` value of `false` will be present in this
    array (they'll all be filtered out).

    `undefined` (or not set) if support of that Representation is unknown or if does not
    make sense here.

  - `decipherable` (`Boolean|undefined`): If `true` the Representation can be deciphered
    (in the eventuality it had DRM-related protection).

    Note that unless you set the `filterPlayableRepresentations` option to `false`, no
    Representation with a `isCodecSupported` value of `false` will be present in this
    array (they'll all be filtered out).

  - `contentProtections` (`Object|undefined`): Encryption information linked to this
    Representation.

    If set to an Object, the Representation is known to be encrypted. If unset or set to
    `undefined` the Representation is either unencrypted or we don't know if it is.

    When set to an object, it may contain the following properties:

    - `keyIds` (`Array.<Uint8Array>|undefined`): Known key ids linked to that
      Representation.

- `signInterpreted` (`Boolean|undefined`): If set to `true`, the track is known to contain
  an interpretation in sign language. If set to `false`, the track is known to not contain
  that type of content. If not set or set to undefined we don't know whether that video
  track contains an interpretation in sign language.

- `trickModeTracks` (`Array.<Object> | undefined`): Trick mode video tracks attached to
  this video track.

  Each of those objects contain the same properties that a regular video track (same
  properties than what is documented here).

  It this property is either `undefined` or not set, then this track has no linked
  trickmode video track.

### Asking for a specific Period

You can also get the list of available video tracks for a specific Period by calling
`getAvailableVideoTracks` with the corresponding Period's id in argument. Such id can be
obtained through the `getAvailablePeriods` method, the `newAvailablePeriods` event or the
`periodChange` event.

```js
// example: getting the video track list for the first Period
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
console.log(rxPlayer.getAvailableVideoTracks(periods[0].id);
```

### Including Representations that cannot be played

You can also ask `getAvailableVideoTracks` to include in its response `Representation`
objects which will not be played because they have their `isCodecSupported` or
`decipherable` property set to `false` (those are filtered out by default, as indicated
above).

To do this, you can provide an object to `getAvailableVideoTracks` with a
`filterPlayableRepresentations` property set to `false` like this:

```js
const videoTrack = player.getAvailableVideoTracks();
```

You may for example also want to know which Representation are not playable to provide
debug information, or to detect deterministically the capabilities of the current device.

Note that this will return the metadata of the available video tracks only for the current
Period. To obtain metadata on all representations for available video tracks from another
Period, you can also set a `periodId` property:

```js
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
console.log(rxPlayer.getAvailableVideoTracks({
    periodId: periods[0].id,
    filterPlayableRepresentations: false,
});
```

<div class="warning">
In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a
href="../Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>), if there is no
supported tracks in the file or no track management API in the browser this
method will return an empty Array.
</div>

## Syntax

```js
// Get list of available video tracks for the currently-playing Period
const videoTracks = player.getAvailableVideoTracks();

// Also include metadata on the non-playable Representations
const videoTracks = player.getAvailableVideoTracks({
  filterPlayableRepresentations: false,
});

// Get list of available video tracks for a specific Period
const videoTracks = player.getAvailableVideoTracks(periodId);

// Get list of available video tracks for a specific Period and also include metadata on
// the non-playable Representations
const videoTracks = player.getAvailableVideoTracks({
  periodId,
  filterPlayableRepresentations: false,
});
```

- **arguments**:

  1.  _arg_ `Object|string|undefined`: If set to a `string`, this is the `id` of the
      Period for which you want to get information about the list of available video
      tracks.

      If not defined, the information associated to the currently-playing Period will be
      returned.

      If set to an Object, the following properties can be set (all optional):

          - `periodId` (`string|undefined`): The `id` of the wanted Period, or
            `undefined` (or not set) for the currently-playing Period

          - `filterPlayableRepresentations` (`boolean|undefined`): If set to `false`,
            Representation that are considered "non-playable" (which have an unsupported
            mime-type/codec or which are undecipherable) will be included.

- **return value** `Array.<Object>`
